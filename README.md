## Description

This project incorporates creating a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema. The routes for this application are handled by using Express. The following is accomplished with this application:

- A user can view, create, and track daily workouts

- Multiple exercises can be logged on a given day

- The name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration can be tracked

- If the exercise is cardio, the distance traveled can be tracked

- A user can view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- A user can view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
